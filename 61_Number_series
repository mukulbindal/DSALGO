"""
The number of *numbers* having 1 digit : 3    ie 3^1   
The number of *numbers* having 2 digits : 9    ie 3^2
The number of *numbers* having 3 digits : 27    ie 3^3
The number of *numbers* having i digits : 3**i    ie 3^i  
// you have 3 digits and i places. repetition is allowed
So the series will be 1,4,13,40.....
ith number will be i-1 th number + 3**i

Or ith number can be Ai = (3**i - 1 )/2
We are given the value of Ai and we need to find i,
Solving the above equation we get:
i = log(2n+1)/log(3)
